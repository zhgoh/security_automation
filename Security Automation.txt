Threat Hunting - Security Automation

Description:

You are a member of a severely understaffed security team that performs security response duties for a stock-trading company, Happy Trading Pte Ltd.

You have just been notified of a sudden performance issue in one of your core servers that runs a critical trading application.

Investigation revealed that it is infected with a sophisticated piece of malware that has infected the server and requires an immediate temporary solution. Due to it being a critical application, the server cannot be rebooted for the time being.


Here are the details of the malware:

The Sleeper executable

    The main malware component - The Sleeper, injects itself into the system processes.
    Killing the Sleeper, makes your application crash and cause it to reboot immediately.
    The Sleeper will spawn at least 3 other Annoying child processes.

The Annoying executable

    The Annoying executable always spawns with a random process name which appears to follow the pattern of an MD5 checksum.
        e.g. 9af75c53a01b2e4277e17f78a3e41b25.exe (Windows) or 9af75c53a01b2e4277e17f78a3e41b25.py (*nix)
    For each Annoying process it connect back to a different C&C Server over tcp/4444.
    Killing each Annoying process will cause the Sleeper to re-spawn a new Annoying process after a 5-minute period, with a new random process name, following the MD5 pattern.
        e.g. bb07fe9441716a8e520cb1d7f0ce3953.exe (Windows) or bb07fe9441716a8e520cb1d7f0ce3953.py (*nix)



Your Task

You as the security response engineer, are to write a program of any language of your choice and the option of doing it on Windows or *nix machines, making assumption that will do the following conditions:

    Search for the presence of the Annoying executable processes at regular intervals.
    Find the C&C Server IP address that each Annoying process is connecting to.
    Kill the Annoying processes.
    Sinkhole the C2 by editing the hosts file, pointing the IP to localhost
        e.g. 11.22.33.44    localhost
